## Introducing ZKP2P

Our mission is to bridge the gap between traditional Web2 platforms and decentralized Web3 platforms in a secure, private and user-friendly way. Our initial focus is to create the cheapest, fastest, lowest fraud and most composable fiat-to-crypto on/off ramp.

### Background

As crypto evolves (DeFi, NFTs, social, on-chain gaming), the necessity for seamless interoperability between fiat and cryptoassets becomes much more important. Existing solutions for onramping are not sufficient to address this need:

‚ùå Not globally inclusive (Coinbase is not available everywhere)

‚ùå High fees for direct onramps (direct onramps charge up to 5%)

‚ùå Complex KYC processes

‚ùå Slow (Coinbase ACH takes 5 days to clear)

‚ùå Not composable with rest of smart contract ecosystem (e.g. fiat to Aave, fiat to Uniswap LP)

### ZKP2P

ZKP2P is the first trust-minimized onramp and offramp protocol powered by advanced cryptography such as zkTLS, MPC, and ZK. These technologies enable permissionless integration with any web2 digital asset transfer platform.

1. **Intent-based onchain escrow**: A smart contract that unlocks tokens upon satisfying a predefined predicate (e.g. send \$X to @my_venmo_account by X time). Users can post offramp liquidity in the smart contract, which acts as a community bulletin board. Onrampers will then signal and fulfill intents to complete these orders.

2. **Crypto primitives** (e.g. zkTLS, zkEmail, TEEs): These authenticate and generate verified proofs satisfying the predicate. Using advanced cryptographic primitives or TEEs, users cannot engage in fraud to generate a false proof.

### Why ZKP2P?

- **Trustless**: By leveraging cryptographic proofs, ZKP2P eliminates the need for intermediaries to settle transactions and disputes, promoting direct peer-to-peer transfers.
- **Private**: ZKP2P ensures the authenticity of transactions while keeping sensitive user data off-chain and hidden from the public.
- **Interoperable**: The protocol is designed to integrate with popular Web2 payment rails, bridging traditional and decentralized finance.
- **Low Fees**: Eliminates intermediaries by using ZK proofs of payment to minimize fees in fiat-to-crypto conversions.
- **Fast**: Enables rapid, permissionless, private transactions that settle efficiently on-chain.

### Looking Ahead

We see the ZKP2P protocol evolving into a global, trustless payment network deployed on-chain. This network will enable permissionless innovation around new payment use cases, providing composability with DeFi, NFTs, games, and beyond.
