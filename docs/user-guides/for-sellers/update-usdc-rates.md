# How to Update USDC Conversion Rates

After creating your deposit in ZKP2P, you may need to adjust your conversion rates to stay competitive or respond to market changes. This guide walks you through how to update your FX rates for existing deposits.

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Deposit Details

- Go to [https://zkp2p.xyz](https://zkp2p.xyz)  
- Click on the **Sell** tab in the main navigation bar  
- Find your active deposit in the list and click to view details  

### Step 2: Locate the Conversion Rates Section

Scroll to the **Conversion Rates** section. You'll see:

- Your configured **payment platforms** (e.g., Revolut)  
- The **currencies** you accept (e.g., GBP, SGD, EUR)  
- The **current conversion rate** for each currency  

### Step 3: Select the Rate to Update

- Find the currency you'd like to update  
- Click the **edit icon (pencil)** next to the current rate  
- The "Update Conversion Rate" screen will appear  

### Step 4: Enter Your New Rate

In the modal, you'll see:

- Platform (e.g., Revolut)  
- Currency (e.g., GBP)  
- Current Rate (e.g., 0.8)  
- **New Conversion Rate** input  

Enter your new rate — e.g., changing **0.8 → 0.795** for GBP.

### Step 5: Confirm Rate Update

- Click the **Update Rate** button  
- Your wallet will prompt you to **sign the transaction**  
- This updates your rate **on-chain** in the smart contract  

### Step 6: Wait for Confirmation

- Wait for the transaction to confirm on the **Base Network**  
- Once confirmed, your updated rate will show in the Conversion Rates section  
- The new rate will apply to **all future orders**  

## Tips for Setting Optimal Rates

### Research Current Market Rates

- Check the **Liquidity** tab to see what other providers offer  
- Look at **external exchanges** for reference FX rates  

### Consider Spread and Competitiveness

- **Lower spreads** (0.5–1%) = faster sales, lower margin  
- **Higher spreads** (1–3%) = higher margin, slower sales  
- Balance depends on your strategy  

### Monitor Performance

After updating rates:

- Monitor how quickly your orders are filled  
- If they're slow to fill → lower your spread  
- If they're filling instantly → raise your spread slightly  

### Currency-Specific Strategies

- High-demand currencies like **EUR** may allow higher spreads  
- Rare currencies might require more competitive rates  
- Optimize for each currency independently
