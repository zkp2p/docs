## Tips for Setting Optimal Rates

### Research Current Market Rates

- Check the Liquidity tab to see what other providers offer  
- Look at external exchanges for reference FX rates  

### Consider Spread and Competitiveness

- **Lower spreads** (0.5–1%) = faster sales, lower margin  
- **Higher spreads** (1–3%) = higher margin, slower sales  
- Balance depends on your strategy  

### Monitor Performance

After updating rates:

- Monitor how quickly your orders are filled  
- If they're slow to fill → lower your spread  
- If they're filling instantly → raise your spread slightly  

### Currency-Specific Strategies

- Popular currencies like EUR may allow higher spreads  
- Rare currencies might require more competitive rates  
- Optimize for each currency independently
