## How to Use These Links for Rate Setting

### 1. Determine Your Base Rate

Check the current market rate for your currency pair (e.g., USD/GBP if you're selling USDC for GBP).

### 2. Calculate Your Spread

Decide on your margin and apply it to the market rate.

Example:

If USD/GBP = **0.78** and you want a **2% spread**, then:  
`0.78 × 0.98 = 0.7644`

So buyers would receive **£0.7644 per USDC** instead of the full rate.

### 3. Compare with Competitors

Check the **Liquidity tab** in ZKP2P to see what other sellers are offering, and adjust your rate accordingly.

### 4. Set Up Alerts

Use TradingView’s alert system to get notified of significant FX moves so you can update your rates in real time.
