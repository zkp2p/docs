# ZKP2P

## Introducing ZKP2P

Our mission is to bridge the gap between traditional Web2 platforms and decentralized Web3 platforms in a secure, private and user-friendly way. Our initial focus is to create the cheapest, fastest, lowest fraud and most composable fiat-to-crypto on/off ramp.

### Background

As crypto evolves (DeFi, NFTs, social, on-chain gaming), the necessity for seamless interoperability between fiat and cryptoassets becomes much more important. Existing solutions for onramping are not sufficient to address this need:

❌ Not globally inclusive (Coinbase is not available everywhere)

❌ High fees for direct onramps (direct onramps charge up to 5%)

❌ Complex KYC processes

❌ Slow (Coinbase ACH takes 5 days to clear)

❌ Not composable with rest of smart contract ecosystem (e.g. fiat to Aave, fiat to Uniswap LP)

### ZKP2P

ZKP2P is the first trust-minimized onramp and offramp protocol powered by advanced cryptography such as zkTLS, MPC, and ZK. These technologies enable permissionless integration with any web2 digital asset transfer platform.

1. **Intent-based onchain escrow**: A smart contract that unlocks tokens upon satisfying a predefined predicate (e.g. send \$X to @my_venmo_account by X time). Users can post offramp liquidity in the smart contract, which acts as a community bulletin board. Onrampers will then signal and fulfill intents to complete these orders.

2. **Crypto primitives** (e.g. zkTLS, zkEmail, TEEs): These authenticate and generate verified proofs satisfying the predicate. Using advanced cryptographic primitives or TEEs, users cannot engage in fraud to generate a false proof.

### Why ZKP2P?

- **Trustless**: By leveraging cryptographic proofs, ZKP2P eliminates the need for intermediaries to settle transactions and disputes, promoting direct peer-to-peer transfers.
- **Private**: ZKP2P ensures the authenticity of transactions while keeping sensitive user data off-chain and hidden from the public.
- **Interoperable**: The protocol is designed to integrate with popular Web2 payment rails, bridging traditional and decentralized finance.
- **Low Fees**: Eliminates intermediaries by using ZK proofs of payment to minimize fees in fiat-to-crypto conversions.
- **Fast**: Enables rapid, permissionless, private transactions that settle efficiently on-chain.

ZKP2P isn’t building a bank, it’s creating a permissionless protocol to match people who need capital with those who have capital; unreliant on institutions. Think of it as an order book of intents, every user becomes a market maker setting their own spread, payment method, and risk profile dependent on their own needs. Similar to how Airbnb lets users set price, dates, rules and availability, ZKP2P facilitates the interaction between capital providers and seekers matching based on intents.

ZKP2P is evolving into global, permissionless Capital-as-a-Service network deployed on-chain. Anyone can deploy idle funds, earn yield, and serve real world demand. ZKP2P isn't just a marketplace,  but programmable infrastructure for permissionless innovation around private, instant payments across borders and platforms.
