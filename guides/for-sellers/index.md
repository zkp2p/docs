# For Sellers

### Why Sell on ZKP2P?

In ZKP2P, all transactions are fully peer-to-peer, meaning onrampers are buying crypto directly from offrampers.

Sellers receive payments on **Revolut, Cash App, Venmo, Wise**, and **Mercado Pago**, and buyers receive **USDC automatically**. Unlike other P2P marketplaces, the ZKP2P protocol **automatically verifies proof of payment** from the buyer using cryptography.

You donâ€™t need to be online to manually release crypto. Simply **deposit USDC** and passively wait for fiat to arrive in your payment account. Charge a spread to earn yield (often **>50% APR**) and rebalance your fiat back into crypto every few days.
