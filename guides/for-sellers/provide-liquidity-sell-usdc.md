## 💡 Important Tips

### Setting Optimal Rates

- Check the **Spread** column in the Liquidity tab  
- Lower spreads (0.5–1%) = faster fills, less profit  
- Higher spreads (1–3%) = slower fills, more profit  

### Security Best Practices

- Start with a **small deposit**  
- Never share your wallet seed phrase  
- Always double-check transaction details  
- Use separate payment accounts for ZKP2P for clean tracking  

### Troubleshooting

- Long pending? Check gas — you need ETH on Base  
- Deposit not appearing? Refresh or reconnect wallet
