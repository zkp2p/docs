# Handling Verification Issues as a Buyer

### Understanding the Verification Process

When you buy USDC or crypto through ZKP2P, the platform tries to automatically verify your payment through a zero-knowledge proof system. Sometimes this verification process can fail due to various reasons:

- The PeerAuth extension couldn't properly load your payment  
- Technical issues with the payment platform

### Step-by-Step: What to Do When Verification Fails

#### Try Again First

1. Click the **"Proof Gen Failed – Try again"** button  
2. Wait 30 seconds for another verification attempt  
3. Sometimes a simple retry solves the issue  

#### Check Your Extension

1. Ensure the **PeerAuth extension** is properly installed and active  
2. If you just installed it, you might need to **refresh the page**  
3. The extension needs proper permissions to access your payment data

#### Contact the Seller or Support via Telegram

If verification continues to fail after multiple attempts:

- Contact the seller or support through Telegram  
- Sellers typically list their Telegram username in their deposit details  

Send the following info to the seller:

- Your order ID or transaction details  
- Screenshot of your payment receipt/confirmation  
- Your wallet address  
- How much you are expected to pay and receive  

#### Be Patient

- The seller may not respond immediately  
- **Do not cancel your payment** through your payment platform while waiting  

### What to Expect When Contacting a Seller

- The seller will ask you to **verify details** about your payment  
- They may request **additional screenshots or information**  
- Once they confirm your payment, they'll **manually release the funds**  
- The process can take some time, depending on the seller's availability
