Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Update docs to replace manual extension opening with SDK helper usage and document all SDK functions.

Constraints/Assumptions:
- Follow workspace instructions; keep ASCII unless existing files require Unicode.

Key decisions:
- None.

State:
- Updated onramp integration doc to remove manual install step and add SDK API reference.

Done:
- Read and refreshed continuity ledger.
- Updated `developer/integrate-zkp2p/integrate-redirect-onramp.md` to use `peerExtensionSdk`.
- Verified no other docs reference `window.peer`.
- Updated `developer-sidebars.js` to use `build-payment-integration`.
- Documented extension SDK functions and helpers in the onramp integration doc.

Now:
- Ready to share doc updates and confirm if additional SDK docs are needed.

Next:
- Expand SDK documentation elsewhere if requested.

Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- None.

Working set (files/ids/commands):
- CONTINUITY.md
- developer/integrate-zkp2p/integrate-redirect-onramp.md
