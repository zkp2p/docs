      content: `From Binance to a New Era Historically, Binance has been the default gateway for users entering crypto; to purchase tokens, either via a CEX or peer-to-peer, and then staying to trade on their perpetual exchange. The stack is integrated and easy to use, but it is centralised, permissioned, and opaque. ZKP2P challenges this model, offering a decentralised, fast, and permissionless fiat onramp that leverages zk proofs and focuses on privacy. When paired with Hyperliquid, it forms a fully on chain alternative that can directly compete with the Binance behemoth. P2P: Centralised vs Permissionless Binance P2P is branded as a peer-to-peer exchange but you need to have: A verified Binance account (KYC) Ad approval from Binance Your funds held in their custody Trust them to facilitate dispute resolution Waiting for seller to be online before receiving your crypto As a seller, you have to be online 24/7 to keep your reputation positive and release funds quickly, you pay a fee to post an advert, and your funds are held in Binance custody. As a buyer, you need to pass KYC for the best prices and sizes, and are at the whim of the seller being online to release the funds to start trading. On the other hand, ZKP2P is a permissionless, non custodial, smart contract based protocol: You do not need an account, just a wallet There is no approval process No reputation to market make Uses zero knowledge proofs to confirm payments Funds are released automatically As a ZKP2P seller, you can sell and create a vault without approval, earn outsized yield while you sleep, and have full control over your funds. As ZKP2P buyer, you don't need to pass additional verification, your time to get your crypto depends on how fast you can send your payment which currently averages 2 minutes and 8 seconds in the last 30 days. A similar comparison can be made with Binance Perps and Hyperliquid. Binance Perps requires: KYC Custodial margin account and is subject to be shutdowns, frozen, or banned regionally In contrast, Hyperliquid is: Fully onchain Self custodial Comparable funding rates Building the Onchain Stack Hyperliquid and ZKP2P are both starting to become more composable within DeFi ecosystems. The former through products like hwHLP, bringing the yield bearing HyperCore asset to HyperEVM, and the latter through 1-click onramps and bridging, and vaults being built on top. They're accelerating the future of a modular, permissionless financial stack where access and liquidity can flow freely. Both protocols are front end agnostic, enabling others to plug into the same infrastructure and fostering ecosystem development and innovation. Getting started with trading on Hyperliquid with ZKP2P is as much easier than getting started with Binance. You can go from your fiat payment app to the casino within 5 minutes: Go to zkp2p.xyz and signal your intentChoose your amount, currency, and payment provider Send your fiat to the counterparty through your payment app Generate the proof using the PeerAuth extension (mobile soon™) Complete your order and bridge to Hypercore Open your perps position on Hyperliquid In the full journey, you never lose custody of your funds, there is nothing locked up, there is no extra KYC or reliance on corporate infrastructure. You Don't Need Permission Centralised platforms are coming under increasing pressure to follow regulations, many countries are cracking down to restrict access, disable features, or exit entire markets. Escrow and fraud are becoming rife in peer-to-peer platforms, especially on Telegram and when platforms rely on reputation as opposed to code. Self custody, privacy, and permissionless access are no longer niche preferences for users, it is a baseline expectation for them. ZKP2P and Hyperliquid are perfectly positioned to meet this expectation. They offer a future where the user controls the flow of fiat <> crypto <> perps without a middleman. Everyone sees the opportunity of being onchain, and everyone wants a piece of the DeFi pie. With talk of Walmart and Amazon exploring stablecoins, and Robinhood tokenising stocks, it's clear that TradFi giants are circling. ZKP2P and Hyperliquid aren't just alternatives to Binance, they're how crypto was meant to work; trustless and modular infrastructure that doesn't need unnecessary verification or account logins. They're going to be the next evolution in how users onboard, trade, and interact onchain. You don't need to ask for permission. You don't need to lose custody of your funds. The CEX-free stack is already live, and can only get better.`

      content: `In a world where crypto users get de-banked, we've heard a lot of questions like "Will Wise close my account if I use ZKP2P?" The short answer is they shouldn't, but the long answer is slightly more complex. It's important to understand exactly what ZKP2P is and what it isn't: ZKP2P isn't an exchange. ZKP2P isn't a custodian. ZKP2P isn't a workaround. ZKP2P is a non-custodial protocol that helps people trade crypto ↔ fiat using everyday payment apps like Wise, Cashapp, or Venmo with cryptographic proof the fiat transfer was completed. You don't give custody of your funds to ZKP2P. You don't rely on Telegram messages and screenshots. You don't trust a middleman. You are just using a smart contract to make your P2P trade verifiable, permissionless, and private. When used properly, it can be no riskier than paying your friend back for coffee. Banks are regulated, and have a duty to ensure that no fraudulent behaviour or transactions that go against their terms and conditions. It is important to note, ZKP2P doesn't interact with your bank, you do! So they key to staying safe is to behave like any other peer-to-peer transaction like sending money to a friend or relative. Here are some best practices that you can use when sending money: Use neutral or blank payment references We all remember sending our friends money with inappropriate references which can be taken quite seriously. Using neutral references like "Transfer", "Invoice" or "Thanks" and avoiding terms like "crypto", "USDC", "p2p payment" or wallet addresses can help ensure your bank does not flag your transaction based on keyword filters. Start with small amounts Before committing to a larger transaction with a new payee, try a small test transaction. This will help avoid triggering fraud protections for an out of ordinary first time transfer. What a good buyer 456e is, small test amount with new payment provider, going bigger after a few days! Don't treat your personal account like a business Most payment apps and banks don't allow brokerage activities on personal accounts, and can lead to behaviour being flagged as abnormal. These filters can apply if you're using ZKP2P or just splitting a bill with your friends. Avoid: Sending similar amount transfers in a short period of time Receiving large, repeated amounts from different buyers Bot-like automation Don't overexpose yourself There is no need to lie in memos, but also no need to overshare in payment references or memos. Your bank doesn't need to know that "you're sending USD to XYZ to buy USDC on Base chain using zero knowledge proofs", but they can know that "you sent money to a peer". ZKP2P isn't inherently risky, but sloppy payment habits can be. Don't try and become a crypto brokerage on your personal Wise account, just follow normal human behaviour. Respect their terms and conditions, keep it clean, neutral, and safe. Not only do good banking habits help protect your account with your payment providers, it's important to recognise that ZKP2P has upgraded the peer-to-peer trading. Sending payments to a CEX to escrow, sending screenshots via TG, or having to trust random people, ZKP2P makes peer-to-peer trading safer, smarter, and more resilient. No custody risk Your funds are always in your control, ZKP2P never has control over your assets. No reliance on screenshots or Telegram messaging Screenshots can be easily faked, there are scammers, ZKP2P uses zero knowledge proofs to prove that the fiat was sent. No middlemen No intermediaries handle your funds, you send direct to your peers leading to fewer points of failure and less regulatory risk No privacy sacrifice Traditional P2P trading involves sharing payment info, receipts, and in some cases ID. ZKP2P use of zero knowledge proofs means that your sensitive data is never shared and never exposed. Permissionless No one needs to approve your access, anyone can use ZKP2P. Works globally, instantly Any two people with a payment method and wallets can trade safely (Missing your payment provider? You can add it yourself! https://github.com/zkp2p/providers) Importantly, you're not doing anything wrong by using ZKP2P. It is how P2P should work; private, verifiable, and permissionless. When used responsibly and with best practices in mind, it's no riskier than reimbursing a friend money when you want to split the bill. Got questions or feedback?

      title: 'Airbnb, but for Your Money',
      excerpt: 'Airbnb transformed how we travel, we stopped staying in boring hotel rooms or paying for a late checkout. Suddenly, you could book homes, apartments or even castles, with a kitchen, garden or desk with a view. ',

      content: `Airbnb transformed how we travel, we stopped staying in boring hotel rooms or paying for a late checkout. Suddenly, you could book homes, apartments or even castles, with a kitchen, garden or desk with a view. Airbnb facilitated the trade between people who wanted a room and people who had a room. ZKP2P is doing the same for on chain money. Stablecoins are becoming mainstream, adding over $110 billion to their market cap in the last 12 months. Everyone is trying to get a piece of the pie, but bringing them on and off chain fast, privately, and easily is still lacking. ZKP2P is becoming more than a marketplace, a "Capital as a Service" provider, a way that users can bring their idle money to earn better than TradFi yield, and bring their earned yield off-chain to meet their real world needs. ZKP2P isn't building a bank, it's creating a permissionless protocol to match people who need capital with those who have capital; unreliant on institutions. Think of it as an order book of intents, every user becomes a market maker setting their own spread, payment method, and risk profile dependent on their own needs. Similar to how Airbnb lets users set price, dates, rules and availability, ZKP2P facilitates the interaction between capital providers and seekers matching based on intents. This order book of intents design unlocks fast, private, and borderless capital movement from day one. Unlike traditional fintechs like Wise, Revolut, or Moonpay who rely on banking integrations, regulations and licenses, ZKP2P doesn't suffer from the same slow, institutional bottlenecks. These platforms charge significant (sometimes hidden) fees for the privilege of on-ramping or swapping your own money, that mean you receive a significantly worse deal. ZKP2P doesn't charge fees, but capital providers earn the spread charged versus the market exchange rate and even at ~3% spread, buyers often receive more money on chain than via traditional onramps. Breaking Down the Cost to On-Ramp Fees aren't the only cost We've seen Coinbase suffer a data breach where ~1% of their users data was leaked; Name, Addresses, Phone Numbers, ID Photos, Bank Details, and Transaction History. These users are now on a literal wrench list with their most sensitive data available to anyone. This is an overlooked risk, when platforms require custody of your data and your money. They can freeze your funds. They can suffer a data breach. And you're left exposed with minimal protections. ZKP2P leverages zero-knowledge proofs verifying data that matters; Date, Payment Amount, Hashed Recipient ID, and Currency, whilst protecting sensitive personal data. This results in a protocol that is open to anyone, anywhere, permissionlessly. Onramp the ZKP2P Way Traditional remittance isn't any better, Banks, Moneygram and Western Union, are slower, expensive and have opaque rules. Whilst interviewing some of our users, they told us about getting cash to his foreign registered Coinbase account from the US. To even get to the on-ramp stage, he has to : 1. Convert USD to EUR 2. Wire EUR to his Foreign Bank 3. Wait for deposit to be credited 4. Send EUR to Coinbase 5. Wait for deposit to be credited 6. Buy Crypto 7. Withdraw on-chain That's a seven step process, across multiple institutions with fees and delays - "sometimes it can take 2 weeks" - just to get their own money on-chain. They admit that they could solve these problems, but they are bureaucratic and time consuming and not what you want to waste your time on. With ZKP2P, they can simply look at the liquidity page, decide which offer they want to take in which currency, send the counterparty the currency, prove the transaction (with zero knowledge), and receive USDC on-chain in an average of 2 minutes and 33 seconds. Western Union and Moneygram revolutionised send money across border, Wise and Revolut came next, and now it is ZKP2P time to do the same. Liquidity providers aren't chasing ponzi yields or points on new stablecoins, they're earning real yield on their stablecoins that would usually flow to large companies like Moonpay or Revolut. Buyers are the same, they aren't giving away sensitive information alongside the privilege to pay extortionate fees, they're settling with their peers instantly and on their own terms. It passes through traditional bottlenecks of waiting to receive your money, capital flows to where it is wanted, generating returns for those provide and liquidity for those who need it. Airbnb reimagined hotels. Uber reimagined taxis. ZKP2P is reimagining capital as something you can share and earn from privately and without permission.`

      content: `Today, we're launching ZKP2P V2, the next version of our decentralized on/offramp protocol. Swap to ETH, USDC, Solana, memecoins and more using Venmo, Cashapp, Wise or Revolut–with no fees, no intrusive identity verification and near-instant settlement. Get started at zkp2p.xyz ZKP2P V1 was launched in November 2023 as a proof of concept demonstrating the first-ever onchain, trust-minimized and peer-to-peer on/off-ramp. Sellers could provide USDC liquidity to an escrow smart contract, while buyers used ZKEmail to prove they had sent Venmo payments to the seller to instantly unlock funds—no centralized intermediaries required for settlement or dispute resolution. Since then, our team has spent 2024 exploring applications using additional primitives such as zkEmail, zkTLS, TLSNotary to facilitate the creation of novel markets to trade digital goods onchain. These include: Global on/off-ramps for INR, TRY, EUR, and GBP, powered by zkEmail and TLSNotary A P2P aftermarket exchange for Web2 domains A secondary ticketing marketplace for Ticketmaster tickets with 90% lower fees Revisiting the Onboarding Problem As our tech stack matured the past year, we're now doubling down on the most impactful market that we believe zkTLS enables–seamless and permissionless flow between fiat and crypto. Despite the promise of Bitcoin as P2P electronic cash, payments on crypto rails have yet to be widely adopted globally and DeFi largely exists as a parallel financial system. This is because getting value across web2 and web3 is still the major bottleneck. Existing solutions fall short in crucial ways: Limited global availability (e.g., Coinbase not accessible in every jurisdiction) Lack of composability (can't directly use USD to buy long-tail assets in a single step) High fees (some direct onramps charge up to 5%) Cumbersome KYC and multi-step processes A frictionless and permissionless on/offboarding protocol means anyone can easily access the broader crypto ecosystem with no geographic or financial barrier. Introducing ZKP2P v2 V2 incorporates the latest in programmable cryptography systems, product and UX flows. Here's what's new: 1. Swap to any token on any chain. Previously, we were limited to onramping to USDC on Base. Now, we aggregate intent-based bridges (like Relay) to enable near-instant bridging and swaps across multiple chains (e.g., Ethereum, Solana). 2. Capital efficiency for liquidity providers (LPs). In V1, liquidity was siloed into separate pools. In V2, you can deploy liquidity once and provide it to any supported payment platforms you specify simultaneously. Each new platform integration adds another source of yield—without requiring more locked capital. 3. Permissionless integration. V2 is open source and deployed onchain, meaning applications can permissionlessly integrate and compose actions on top–unlike centralized solutions which for example require developers to KYC. 4. Streamlined workflow. We've rewritten our entire stack to significantly reduce the number of steps required for onramping. This includes usage of a headless extension flow and appclips on mobile for verifying payments–no more popups or app downloads. Onramping fiat to crypto end-to-end now takes around 60 seconds. In V1, we supported 4 currencies (INR, USD, TRY, EUR). V2 now supports 23 currencies. In V1, we only supported Base and USDC as the only chain and asset. V2 initially supports 4 chains (Solana, Base, Ethereum, Polygon) and many more tokens including ETH, SOL, POL, TRUMP, AERO and more. Under the Hood To recap, the ZKP2P V1 protocol was a simple construction: Seller locks onchain assets in an escrow smart contract Buyer pays seller offchain using any supported payment platform Buyer unlocks onchain assets atomically by submitting a proof of payment generated using ZK or MPC to the escrow ZKP2P V2 supercharges this base V1 workflow with 2 new design considerations in mind: extensibility and separation of concerns. Extensibility: V2 is designed to be maximally flexible, which means a generic escrow protocol that supports any ERC20 token and unlocking condition. These predicates can be defined using any programmable crypto primitive including zkEmail, zkTLS, MPCTLS, and TEEs (and anything in the future). For example, we can support: 1. If Venmo sends an email attesting to $X was transferred to Y person 2. If venmo.com returns an API response saying $X was transferred to Y person and is proven using zkTLS 3. If a TEE attests to that $X was transferred to Y person 4. If a decentralized verifier committee resolves an attestation that $X was transferred correctly Our PeerAuth extension is the interface to authenticating into and generating proofs for each of these primitives. Developers can integrate new payment platforms in days rather than months—no custom ZK circuits required. At launch, we currently support the proxy-TLS protocol, but will be quickly rolling out support for MPC-TLS, TEEs and zkEmail. Separation of concerns V2 is designed to optimize what each layer of our stack does best. Onchain for custody of funds and settlement of escrow transactions (the protocol will always remain non custodial). And offchain for any periphery logic. In particular, we introduce an offchain relayer role that relays payee details, gates liquidity based on seller requirements, and abstracts gas and wallet signing. Today, anyone can run a relaying service fully customizable to how they want to serve their users, should they choose to not user ZKP2P's default relayer. For example, a relayer that: Collects additional KYC to serve high limit OTC trades Only serves a small community Users can also opt to not use a relayer and choose to use the blockchain directly as a database (similar to ZKP2P V1) For more details on our tech stack, check out our docs. Whats next Launch is just the beginning. We're committed to: Expanding currency and token support (more local payment methods, more crypto assets) Further reducing proof generation times—or removing the need for onramper proofs altogether while preserving privacy Increasing transaction limits and exploring new transaction types (e.g., subscription flows, large trades) Improving support for integrations, such as APIs, SDKs and importable UI components Decentralizing the stack over time and making ZKP2P unstoppable and autonomous Reach out DMs are open! Email us at team@zkp2p.xyz or ping us on Telegram @zk_p2p. Liquidity Providers: We're looking for LPs to power on/off-ramps across the globe. If you post liquidity / ads on existing P2P platforms like Binance P2P, we would love to chat about how ZKP2P plugs into your existing workflow. Integration Partners: If you're building an app or wallet and want to enable a fast, cheap and no unnecessary KYC onramping solution for your users, we would love to see how we can help. Developers: Want to integrate a new payment platform (or your local bank) into ZKP2P V2? We'll help you get started.
